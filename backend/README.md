# spread-love (GraphQL Backend)

This is the GraphQL backend powered by apollo-server and now (v2!).

Currently hosted at https://backend-gu2bfuoev.now.sh/graphql

## Getting started

This is a monorepo, so simply run `yarn` in the root of the repo, and all dependencies will be installed.

### Running the server

```bash
cd backend
yarn start
```
